\arguments{
\item{A}{matrix to decompose}

\item{d}{number of singular vectors}

\item{adjust}{extra singular vectors to calculate for accuracy}

\item{tol}{convergence criterion}

\item{V}{optional initial guess}

\item{seed}{seed}

\item{ltrace}{debugging output}

\item{override}{TRUE means we use fast.svd instead of the iterative}

\item{force}{If TRUE, forces the Lanczos algorithm to be used on all datasets (usually fast.svd is used on small datasets and other conditions)
algorithm (useful for small data or very high d).}
}
\value{
list with singular value decomposition.

\description{
Truncated SVD
}
\details{
Performs singular value decomposition but only returns the first
\code{d} singular vectors/values. The truncated SVD utilizes Lanczos
bidiagonalization. See references.

This function was modified from the package irlba 1.0.1 under
GPL. Replacing the \code{crossprod()} calls with the C wrapper to
\code{dgemv} is a dramatic difference in larger datasets. Since the
wrapper is technically not a matrix multiplication function, it seemed
wise to make a copy of the function.
